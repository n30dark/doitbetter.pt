I. OVERVIEW

    CSS Joiner is a realtime CSS optimizer, you may use in your web
    site/application to minimize CSS code returned from your web server.
    Multiple local or external files can be loaded just like single CSS file -
    using single <link> tag (one server request). Caching system is available
    for faster responses - generate and save compressed CSS code once, until
    change in source CSS files is done.


II. FEATURES

    1. Load multile CSS files in single <link> tag.
    2. Transform url() paths of external CSS files.
    3. If source CSS files are not provided, CSS Joiner will parse all CSS
       files in the script's directory.
    4. Parse only new requests or/and modified CSS files, and return
       compressed content from cache.
    5. Browser-side cache.
    6. HTTP referer protection to avoid external use.


III. REQUIREMENTS

    1. Web server (Apache 2 on Linux is tested only)
    2. PHP 5.x.x. Optional mod_rewrite module for non-parameter URLS


IV. INSTALLATION

    For security reasons local files with .css extension only can be parsed.
    To parse all .css files in a directory in your site (e.g. /css):

    1. Upload index.php from CSS Joiner package to /css directory on your site
    2. Create /css/cache directory writable for the web server.
    3. In <head> tag create <link> tag pointed to /css directory URL. Example:

        <link href="/css/" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

    The files will be parsed in alphabetical order. You may rename CSS files
    for wished parse order. For example you can add numbers at the beginning
    of the file names.

    For selective files parsing you may add css[] GET parameters pointed to
    source CSS files you want to parse. It's recommended to URL-encode these
    parameters. Example:

        http://your.site.com/css/?css[]=common.css&css[]=%2Fapp%2Fstyle.css&css=[]=%2Fnew_css&css[]=http%3A%2F%2Fexternal.site.com%2Fstyle.css

    This example will parse folowing files if they exists and can be read in
    order they arranged in the URL:

    1. /css/common.css - if not exists CSS Joiner will try to parse /common.css
    2. /app/style.css - a file outside /css directory
    3. /new_css - all .css files in /new_css directory in alphabetical order
       (works only for local files)
    4. http://external.site.com/style.css - this external file will be parsed
       if allow_url_fopen PHP ini setting is enabled.

    If you want to use mod_rewrite URL style, you should upload .htaccess from
    CSS Joiner package to /css. The parsed CSS URL should be transformed to:

        http://your.site.com/css/common.css../app/style.css../new_css..http://external.site.com/style.css

    The files are separated by .. delimiter. You may change the delimiter
    editing /css/index.php. At the beginning of the file there are several
    configurable options defined as protected fields with commented
    descriptions.
